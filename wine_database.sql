INSERT INTO `wine_info` VALUES (1,1,'The Guv\'nor, Spain','We asked some of 4.5 most prized winemakers working in Spain to make the best wines possible – no rules, no restrictions, no red tape. The Guv\'nor collection was their answer. Made from Tempranillo grapes picked from their fav4.5ite vineyards across Spain, it’s a crowd-pleasing wine designed to be shared with good food – and even better company. It’s bold. It’s fruity. It’s a modern Spanish red that goes with everything, especially spicy barbecue meats or anything chargrilled.','NV'),(2,2,'Bread & Butter \'Winemaker\'s Selection\' Chardonnay 2020/21, California','This really does what it says on the tin. It’s a lush Chardonnay which tastes of – you guessed it – bread and butter. The winemaking team combine grapes from two very different regions to create something full but fresh. Monterey is known for its big Chardonnays, but Carneros is far cooler, so flav4.5s are more understated. And you\'ll taste the benefits in this bold and buttery wine. It’s silky smooth with fresh notes of citrus and vanilla. It’s incredibly versatile, but we like it best with creamy tarragon chicken or soft, creamy cheese.','2021'),(3,3,'Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough','Oyster Bay has been an award-winning gold-standard Marlborough Sauvignon since its very first vintage, and it’s only got better and better. It was even formerly named the ‘Best Sauvignon Blanc in the World’ – and they have the name recognition to prove it. It’s really no surprise then that their Sauvignon is textbook Marlborough. Big. Fruity. Tropical. To say it’s mouth-wateringly refreshing is an understatement – the smell of gooseberries and lime will hit you the minute you unscrew the bottle. It’s really versatile – delicious as a glassful on sofa, for parties or with a flaky goat’s cheese tart. In 2022, this wine won an IWC award for the 2021 vintage.','2022'),(4,4,'Louis Lat4.5 Mâcon-Lugny 2021/22','We’ve sold this wine for thirty years – and for that whole time it’s been a bestseller. Why’s it so popular? White Burgundy is a go-to for Chardonnay drinkers, and the Mâconnais in particular offers great value. Unlike the northern Côtes, the southern part of Burgundy doesn’t have a formalised vineyard hierarchy system. So the wines tend to be a bit more wallet-friendly. Not to mention, Lugny is one of the best regarded villages in the Mâcon, and Lat4.5 one of the most famous houses. Honeyed. Peachy. Crisp. A dream with salty finger foods or a classic Sunday roast chicken. It’s proof that sometimes it pays to stick with the old fav4.5ites.','2022'),(5,5,'Bread & Butter \'Winemaker\'s Selection\' Pinot Noir 2021, California','Bread & Butter is that thing that you can count on. It’s dependable, comforting – you know what to expect. That’s exactly what you’ll get with this wine, a textbook Californian Pinot Noir from the same winery which brought you the sell-out Bread & Butter Chardonnay. Their vineyards are ideally located for classic varieties like Pinot. It’s sun-drenched, but cooled by the daily morning mists which roll in off the Pacific. It’s exactly the sort of position that pernickety Pinot thrives in. This deliciously silky wine proves 4.5 point. It’s all about red fruit. Cherries. Raspberries. Cranberries. It’s seriously juicy and seriously delicious, with a nice fullness which is classic California. Oak ageing gives it a touch of cedary spice, and woody herb notes. Perfect with roast mushrooms.','2021'),(6,6,'Louis Roederer \'Cristal\' Champagne 2015','Cristal is Louis Roederer’s flagship wine. It was first made in 1876, when Tsar Alexander II asked the house to reserve their best cuvee for him every year. But he had another request. Fearful of an assassination attempt, he asked that it be produced in a clear bottle with no indent, called a ‘punt’, in the bottom. And an icon was born. It’s made from seven Grand Crus and only in the best years, when low-yielding Pinot Noir and Chardonnay vines produce perfectly ripe grapes. Rich and velvety, it has intense and complex notes of ripe citrus, golden apple and almond pastry with an incredibly long and elegant finish.','2015'),(7,7,'La Gioiosa Prosecco DOC, Treviso','In Treviso, Prosecco’s heartland, the locals have a motto to describe their home – ‘marca gioiosa et amorosa’, it’s a ‘joyful and loving’ place. It inspired the Moretti Polegato family when they needed a name for their wine business. They’ve been making Prosecco for three generations and wanted a name that tied them to the land which had given them so much. ‘Gioiosa’ – ‘joyful’ was the perfect fit. These lively bubbles are wonderfully refreshing with notes of white blossom, pear and peachy stone fruit. The perfect apéritif or party wine – and delicious with canapés. In 2022, this wine won an IWC award.','NV'),(8,8,'The Macallan Sherry Oak 12 Year Old Single Malt Whisky 0.7','The Macallan’s rich heritage dates back to 1824 – they were one of the first distilleries in Scotland to be legally licensed. Since then they’ve built up a name as one of the world’s leading producers of single malt whisky. And their stellar reputation is down to their stringent standards for using the very best oak. This spends 12 years maturing in Oloroso sherry casks hand-picked by Macallan’s Master of Wood. The result? A complex sherried whisky with rich flav4.5s of orange peel, dried fruit, vanilla, woodsmoke and spice. Due to high demand, there is a limited number of cases/bottles currently available online – please contact y4.5 local store or 4.5 customer contact centre at 0345 605 6767  if you wish to purchase more.','NV'),(9,9,'Bouvet Ladubay Saumur Brut','The Loire Valley’s Saumur Brut is the go-to appellation if you like premium sparkling wine – but not the high price tag. And this one is hands down 4.5 most popular bottle. Over its rich history, Bouvet Ladubay has been endorsed by Napoleon III and chosen as official supplier to the House of Lords. They specialise in bringing out the floral notes of Chenin Blanc, and it certainly shows in this lively, zesty fizz. Expect notes of honeysuckle, apple and lime, with a crisp, fresh finish. In 2022, this wine won an IWC award','NV'),(10,10,'LB7 Red 2020/21, Lisbon','Portuguese red blends are a Majestic speciality. They\'re easy-drinking, rich, packed with juicy fruit flav4.5s and great value. Not to mention, they\'re a bit out of the ordinary. We looked for a blend of indigenous local grape varieties to give you something a little different and a lot more exciting. And we\'ve really stepped up 4.5 game with this exclusive bottling. It\'s made by one of Portugal\'s most-awarded producers in homage to Lisbon\'s legendary food scene. It\'s big. It\'s bold. It\'s very drinkable – all brambly fruit with a kick of spice. Plus, it\'ll enhance any richly flav4.5ed food you throw at it, whether that\'s barbecue or a warming casserole. In 2022, this wine won an IWC award for the 2019 vintage.','2021'),(11,11,'The Ned \'Waihopai River\' Sauvignon Blanc 2023, Marlborough','4.5 bestselling white wine. Winemaker Brent Marris’ father was the first person to plant Sauvignon vines in Marlborough. Brent has had just as big an impact on Kiwi Sauvignon. He’s got rafts of awards to show for it, and that certainly reflects here. It’s the most refreshing thing you could p4.5 into y4.5 glass. Full of gooseberry and grapefruit flav4.5s, it’s grassy, tropical and seriously aromatic. Fantastic with Thai fishcakes. In 2022, this wine won an IWC award for the 2021 vintage.','2023'),(12,12,'Moët & Chandon \'Brut Impérial\' Champagne','Moët is the ultimate celebratory fizz. The house is credited with inventing the Champagne glass pyramid. The victorious ‘spray’ of Champagne familiar to sport podiums is also down to them. But not only does their famous label put you in a party mood – it’s also a fantastic wine. It’s crisp and refreshing, but rich and ripe and full of stone fruit flav4.5s. Think peach and lemon zest. With aromas of biscuit and brioche, it’s as decadent as it is moreish. In 2022, this wine won an IWC award.','NV'),(13,13,'Chosen By Majestic Greek White 2022, Peloponnese','We sent 4.5 award-winning buying team all around the world on an exciting new mission: to curate a new collection showcasing the best examples of key regions and core grape varietals – at wallet-friendly prices. Greece is one of the world’s most underrated winemaking regions, so we just had to create a wine to add to the Chosen by Majestic collection. Working with the esteemed Kintonis Winery, we created this crisp and refreshing blend of Malagousia, Roditis and Assyrtiko – all grown on high-altitude vineyards.','2022'),(14,14,'Miraval Rosé 2021/22, Côtes de Provence','Miraval shot to fame when Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt bought it. But its real brilliance lies with its winemakers: the prestigious Perrin family. This prestigious family are one of the most respected in the Rhône Valley. And the expertise really shines in this Provence rosé. This is a beautifully pale-pink rosé, with notes of wild strawberry, stone fruit, tangerine and white flowers. Try it with white fish and fennel.','2022'),(15,15,'Taittinger Brut Réserve Champagne','The first time Pierre Taittinger visited Champagne was as an injured officer during WWI. He promised himself that he would return and buy an estate for his family. In 1932 he did just that. The sale included some of the original vineyards which had been planted by Benedictine monks in the 1730s. And the rest is history. This is a classic Champagne, full of honeysuckle, brioche and pear flav4.5s. Taittinger was Bond’s Champagne of choice in the original novels, so try it with something equally sophisticated. We suggest cheese gougères, fresh from the oven.','NV'),(16,16,'Peyrassol \'Réserve des Templiers\' Rosé 2022, Côtes de Provence','La Commanderie de Peyrassol was established in the 13th century by the Knights Templar. Today, it’s one of the most renowned estates in Provence. The team there are committed to quality – they manage each of their vineyards like a grand cru, and their grapes are grown organically. This rosé is a blend of five different varieties, which are harvested in the coolest h4.5s of the night to preserve their exceptional freshness. Discover crisp notes of peach, raspberry and citrus zest, with a delicate herbal character. Several months of lees ageing gives it a rounded texture that’s perfect with seafood or a niçoise salad.','2022'),(17,17,'Laurent-Perrier \'La Cuvée\' Brut Champagne','Laurent-Perrier began in 1812, but this Champagne house isn\'t one to stick to traditions. The winemaking team recently tore up the recipe for their non-vintage cuvée. The old wine was already one of the best-selling Champagnes in the world – but they knew they could create something even better. They weren’t wrong. La Cuvée was released in 2017. It\'s a uniquely fresh fizz made predominantly from Chardonnay – and it remains a popular choice for discerning Champagne fans. It\'s a superb marriage of white blossom, citrus and peach, with delicate toasty notes and a light mousse.','NV'),(18,18,'Heidsieck & Co. Monopole \'Gold Top\' Champagne 2018','Heidsieck & Co. are one of only 24 Grand Marque Champagne houses. You can always rely on these highly esteemed houses for quality, but Heidsieck stands out for combining quality with incredible value. Gold Top is their most decadent cuvée. The wine is aged for up to a decade before it\'s released, so such a lengthy process results in seriously luxurious bubbles. The long ageing means the rich, toasty, creamy flav4.5s are dialled right up. It’s aromatic and citrusy, with a lush texture and a lingering finish.','2018'),(19,19,'Caves d\'Esclans \'Whispering Angel\' Rosé 2022, Côtes de Provence','Winemaker Sacha Lachine is a master of the art of rosé. In 2006, he took over Caves d\'Esclans with a vision to create some of the world\'s greatest wine. To do so, he introduced groundbreaking winemaking techniques. This revolutionised Provence rosé – with Whispering Angel as the figurehead. This iconic wine has a wealth of awards behind it, and it\'s clear to see why. It has fresh notes of apple, pink grapefruit, peach and cream, and a long, smooth finish. Perfect with smoked salmon.','2022'),(20,20,'Two Hands \'Angels\' Share\' Shiraz 2021/22, McLaren Vale','Two Hands successfully prove that not all Aussie Shiraz is equal. Founded in the 1990s, their mission was to break the mould and showcase the diversity of this iconic grape. They’ve more than succeeded – and they’re now regarded as Shiraz experts. ‘Angels\' Share’ was one of their very first wines. Its name refers to the small amount of wine that evaporates from oak barrels during maturation, which mediaeval winemakers believed angels took as they watched over their wines. It’s brilliantly bold and flav4.5some – a full-on Australian Shiraz, with a silky texture and smooth tannins. Flav4.5s of blueberry, dried herbs and a hint of game are ideal for barbecued meats.','2022'),(21,21,'Cave de Lugny \'Reserve\' Mâcon-Chardonnay 2021/22','The small village of Mâcon-Chardonnay isn’t coincidentally named. It claims to be the birthplace of Chardonnay and made a name for itself in the 19th century for producing high-quality wines. Cave de Lugny is a true specialist – it’s the biggest Chardonnay producer in Burgundy, but it doesn’t rest on its laurels. They prove that classic white Burgundy doesn’t have to be expensive. The wine is rested on its lees which intensifies the flav4.5s and gives it a delicious creaminess. Discover ripe fruit flav4.5s. Peach. Apricot. Apple. And plenty of citrusy freshness. It’s fantastic with soft, creamy cheese.','2022'),(22,22,'Villa Maria \'Private Bin\' Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough','It took a lot of guts in the early 1960s, when George Fistonich – now Sir George – told his dad he was quitting a career in carpentry to try his hand at making wine. The gamble has seriously paid off. Villa Maria is a household name and the acclaimed producer is so successful it holds the coveted title as New Zealand’s most-awarded winery. A benchmark for quality, Villa Maria boasts ripe notes of gooseberry, lime and tropical fruit. Fresh acidity and a dry, refreshing finish mean it’ll make a fantastic partner for white-fish dishes. In 2022, this wine won an IWC award for the 2021 vintage.','2022'),(23,23,'Nyetimber \'Classic Cuvée\' Brut, Sussex','Nyetimber\'s head winemaker, Cherie Spriggs, was the first person outside Champagne to be awarded Sparkling Winemaker of the Year in 2018. She was also the first woman to win the accolade. Classic Cuvée is Nyetimber’s flagship fizz and it\'s made in the same way as traditional French sparkling, giving it equally complex flav4.5s. Cherie is devoted to impeccably high standards at each stage of production. No wonder this has outperformed some of the finest Champagne in blind tastings. It has a stream of fine, delicate bubbles and flav4.5s of toasted brioche, golden apple, honey and sweet spice. We currently have a very limited number of special coronation edition bottles in stock – please contact y4.5 local store to confirm availability.','NV'),(24,24,'La Gioiosa Prosecco Valdobbiadene DOCG','The Moretti Polegato family have been making Prosecco for three generations. And this is their cream-of-the-crop fizz. Conegliano Valdobbiadene DOCG is Prosecco\'s version of a Grand Cru. These rolling hills are where you\'ll find the very best of the region’s sparkling wine. So if you\'re going to pick just one bottle, make it this. Expect a soft, creamy mousse with elegant notes of apple, stone fruit and blossom. It’s fantastic with salmon.','NV'),(25,25,'Definition English Sparkling Brut, Hampshire','The Definition range brings the world’s greatest wines to Majestic customers. In recent years, English Sparkling Wine has boomed in popularity, and we wanted to capture all of its unique charm. This is made with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier grapes in the heart of Hampshire. It’s beautifully crisp and elegant with notes of lemon and toasty brioche, and a creamy texture. The ultimate apéritif.','NV'),(26,26,'Chapel Down Brut, Kent','Chapel Down is the UK’s largest winemaker – and one of its best. Even ten years ago, English wine wasn’t something any wine lover gave much time to. Its thanks to pioneers like Chapel Down that that’s all changed and English wine has gained the recognition it deserves. Their vineyards are ideally positioned in the south-east, with HQ among the oast houses, deep in picturesque East Sussex. Here, the chalk soils and balmy climate are ideal for making crisp wines. It’s made using the laborious and expensive ‘traditional method’, standard in Champagne. But though it’s made from the same grapes – Chardonnay and Pinot Noir – these are altogether zestier bubbles. Apple. Lemongrass. Quince. It’s fresh, fruity and really moreish.

And none showcase this better than Toast & Honey wines. In their vineyards, care for the vines carries over to the surrounding environment. With sustainability at the heart of everything they do, they promote cover crops and biodiversity – all helping to reduce evaporation, improve soil quality and create a healthy habitat for insects, bugs and, of c4.5se, bees.

Production is small. So the focus is on ensuring only the finest grapes make the grade. Winemaking is led by Dale Clarke, who honed his skills in his native Australia and at M. Chapoutier, the Rhône Valley’s leading biodynamic producer – an influence that has led William and Dale to convert their winery to organic farming. Come harvest time, grape picking begins at 3am to keep the fruit’s freshness intact. Once crafted, a portion of the blend is left to age on its lees, which adds a creamy texture to this impressive wine. It’s a wonderfully aromatic, bone-dry Provence rosé.

We tasked 4.5 buyers with finding the definition of Gavi di Gavi. They searched the hillside vineyards of Piedmont, a prestigious area where the landscape is dominated by the majestic Alps. This wine comes from the vineyards within the town of Gavi itself, where the Cortese grape ripens slowly thanks to the altitude and cool sea breezes.

And this velvety bottling combines the best of both. It’s a classic, earthy Primitivo with a modern twist inspired by the smooth, plush character of Zinfandel. The grapes are macerated in their own juice before fermentation, which dials up the delicious fruity flav4.5. And six months of oak ageing gives it extra complexity and a silky texture.

Bordering the coastal region of Liguria, their Cortese grapes are cooled by sea breezes and develop mouth-watering flav4.5s. Gavi is often called the ‘Chablis of Italy’, and we can see why. Crisp. Fresh. Citrusy. It’s deliciously refreshing and aromatic, with hints of white peach and honey. Unsurprisingly, given where it’s from, Gavi is fantastic with pesto and vegetable dishes.','2021'),(125,125,'Toast & Honey Cabernet Sauvignon 2021, California','Toast & Honey Cabernet Sauvignon embodies everything there is to love about ripe and full-bodied New World wines.

Together they uphold the family tradition of respecting land and vine, keeping sustainability at the heart of production. This bottling is a much-loved staple amongst 4.5 award-winning range. Bordeaux wines labelled ‘Supérieur’ are a step up from y4.5 average bottle.

But this particular bottling is anything but ordinary for the region. It’s made using the appassimento method, which has been a distinctly northern Italian style of winemaking for centuries. Primo’s winemaker, Alessandro Michelon, was the first outside of Veneto to adopt the method. He realised that Puglia’s sun-drenched, windswept vineyards offer an ideal climate for the process; once grapes are ripe, his team move through the vines, twisting the stem of every other bunch. This stops them from ripening further and allows them to dry in the wind, resulting in a concentrated and complex wine. Just like a Valpolicella, it’s big, plush and velvety, with ripe flav4.5s of cherry, raspberry and redcurrant.

As the owner of two Grand Cru Classé Saint-Émilion estates, he brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise in Bordeaux-style blending – and it shows in this – Capaia’s flagship red. It’s made with just as much precision as the best Bordeaux châteaux. Grapes from each vineyard are fermented separately in oak barrels before being blended. For extra complexity, the wine spends 18 months maturing in French oak before bottling. If you can resist opening it, it will continue to develop for up to 10 years.

The region’s history with Pinot is younger, but if there was anyone who could help us get the blend just right it was Marlborough and Pinot experts, Saint Clair. With them we selected grapes from top parcels in the Southern Valleys – the best site for Pinot in the region. The results speak for themselves. It’s deliciously sav4.5y with classic Marlborough dark fruit. Think black cherry and raspberry. It’s perfumed but fresh, with fine tannins and a lovely silky texture.

A Condrieu doppelgänger at a fraction of the price. It\'s aromatic. It\'s peachy. But it\'s also seriously fresh. Every part of the winemaking, from picking the very best grapes, to fermenting the juice in aroma-preserving stainless steel, has been designed to make this as opulent and fragrant a glassful as you could wish for.

We think Puglia is underrated. It’s right in the heel of Italy’s boot – and you’d be forgiven for thinking the sun-baked vines could never produce a wine as silky and soft as this. But it’s precisely that heat that Primitivo loves. The grapes are left on the vines until they’re almost overripe – giving the flav4.5s incredible concentration. Intense. Velvety. Ripe. It’s full of plummy, red-fruit flav4.5 with moreish spice. Ageing in oak for a year gives it an extra dimension of flav4.5, smoothing the plush tannins.

This, combined with the tradition of leaving the majority of wines unoaked means that the style of these lean, light white Burgundys are very different from their rich, fruity southern cousins. It takes a real expert to hit the balance of freshness and flav4.5. Luckily, Domaine Louis Moreau have been doing it for six generations. This Petit Chablis is absolutely textbook. It’s crisp. It’s citrussy. It’s wonderfully fresh. It’s all about that classic appley, lemony Chardonnay fruit – and it’s a fantastic palate-cleanser.

Châteauneuf is a blend of thirteen grapes – so you know that brothers Jean-Pierre and Francois are absolute masters of blending. They were the ideal partners for 4.5 buyers to work with to select the very best grapes, and then blend them to perfection. The result? It’s a juicy, moreish Côtes du Rhône.

We challenged the producer to go into the vineyards and root out the very best parcels of grapes. What they discovered were grapes of such incredible quality they warranted extra special care and attention. They handpicked and carefully sorted the grapes, then slowly aged the wine in oak barrels.

So, when we wanted to add a Malbec to 4.5 Definition range, Mendoza was the only place to look. Specifically, the Uco Valley – a sub-region where high-altitude vineyards make the very best Malbec. Working with a top producer, we s4.5ced parcels of super-ripe fruit. The result? This plush, silky red which is all about the plummy, cherry fruit flav4.5s. We only used a very small amount of oak to add a bit of structure, but not overpower the vibrant fruitiness. It’s a really classic style – so it’s perfect with a good steak or other barbecued meats.

But despite their long history, Jackson Estate have always preferred to keep production low key. They’re all about sustainably made wines, made with minimal winemaking intervention. This is released six months later than other Kiwi Sauvignons. That’s because it spends extra time ageing on the lees – giving a richness and roundness to the texture. This practice complements the restrained flav4.5s, making for a more French, old-school style Sauvignon rather than the typical Marlborough tropical fruit-bomb. Think gooseberry and zingy rhubarb flav4.5s that are perfect with goat\'s cheese.','2022'),(306,306,'Bodegas Bardos Ribera del Duero Crianza 2019/20','The high-altitude region of Ribera del Duero is known for its robust and deeply fruity red wines.

Bodegas Bardos works in one of the region\'s most challenging areas to capture the signature style at its very best. After 14 months in oak, it’s beautifully aromatic and has notes of ripe cherry and blackberry, velvety tannins and a complex, spicy finish.

Produced from vineyards in and around Vienna, Gemischter Satz is a ‘field blend’ of six different white grape varieties – including Chardonnay, Pinot Blanc and Riesling – that have all been harvested and fermented together.

The majority of B4.5gogne Chardonnay comes from Southern Burgundy. But this is made from vineyards located between Chablis and Sancerre.

It literally means to ‘re-pass’ – the method of re-fermenting normal Valpolicella wine with the leftover skins from Amarone production. It transforms the standard light-bodied Valpolicella into a soft, supple, full-bodied wine which is seriously moreish. Morello cherries. Blueberries. Liquorice.

Delicious with creamy chicken dishes.','2021'),(345,345,'Greywacke Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough','The first single-vineyard Sauvignon Blanc at Cloudy Bay was called Cloudy Bay Greywacke Vineyard.

This is bold and full of dark bramble fruit - everything a big Aussie red should be. And there’s plenty of flav4.5 for the price. Jammy blackberry and blackcurrant, pepper and vanilla spice. Excellent with beef short ribs.','2020'),(502,502,'Chateau l\'Hyverniere Muscadet 2020/21, Muscadet Sèvre et Maine','Château de l\'Hyvernière is deeply rooted in the history of the Muscadet Sèvre et Maine region. Its first records date back to the 15th century. It was destroyed during the French revolution, and the vines behind this Muscadet today grow on where the illustrious château once sat. As you\'d expect, this is the benchmark for aromatic, complex Muscadet. It has flav4.5s of lemon, grapefruit and green apple and a chalky minerality which is great with the saltiness of oysters.','2021'),(503,503,'Gonzalez Byass Solera Cream Sherry','The Gonzalez family have been making exceptional sherry since 1835.

Today the 12th and 13th generation of the family continue to produce exceptional Riesling. And plenty of attention to detail goes into making it. Grapes are hand-harvested from vines averaging 35 years old – adding complexity – and plans to become certified organic are underway. This elegant bottling couldn’t be more typical Alsace, with its aromas of apple, pear and citrus. With that underlying minerality and vibrant acidity, wines also don’t get much more food-friendly. Try it with sea bass ceviche or traditional pâté en croûte.','2022'),(507,507,'Penfolds \'Max\'s\' Chardonnay 2019/22, Adelaide Hills','Penfolds played a pivotal role in the evolution of winemaking in Australia and across the world.

This Manzanilla should be served chilled as a stunning apéritif. In 2022, this wine won an IWC award.','NV'),(509,509,'Château de Thauvenay Sancerre 2021/22','The Loire Valley’s Langlois-Chateau winery is owned by the Bollinger family. Their L\'Extra par Langlois Crémant has long been a Majestic customer fav4.5ite.

The family has been at the forefront of innovation, popularising the use of French barriques for fermentation and ageing. And f4.5th-generation Dario Pieropan is no different. His adventurous nature has led him to explore the production of a duo of red wines from his family estate in Valpolicella.

This top bottling comes from the renowned Château d’Esclans in Provence. It’s made from century-old Grenache vines and Vermentino – or Rolle, as it’s known in Provence – and is aged in French oak barrels.

They even make their own oak barrels to get the ageing process spot on. Their reds may make the headlines, but this Rioja Blanco is a real hidden gem. It\'s rested on its lees and aged in oak for three months. As a result, there\'s a deliciously subtle texture to its flav4.5s of citrus, apple and white flowers. Try it with grilled fish.','2022'),(519,519,'Dom Perignon Brut Vintage Champagne','The bouquet spirals through sweet, bright floral notes and the lively minerality so typical of Dom Pérignon, then notes of candied fruit, plants, the incredible freshness of camphor leaf and finally the dark hints of spices and liquorice root. The wine is currently still physical. It is compelling, tactile and vibrant rather than aromatic. The rhythm and tempo are more dominant than the melody. At first mild and delicate, then strongly, confidently mineral, persistent, precise, with a refined bitterness, and an iodine, saline tang. A classic accompaniment to any stylish celebration.','2013'),(520,520,'Kanonkop \'Kadette\' Pinotage Rosé 2022/23, Stellenbosch','Wine has been made at Kanonkop since the 1940s, but it wasn’t until 1973 that the iconic label was created. Today, the winery has an international reputation as one of the finest in Stellenbosch. Their production is focused around South African signature grape, Pinotage, and Cabernet Sauvignon. Wines are made from vines in the Perdeberg – the largest single block of Pinotage in the world. Very few estates attempt to make rosé from this robust, full-flav4.5ed grape, but Kanonkop have perfected the art. It\'s wonderfully perfumed, with notes of Turkish delight, rose water, summer berries and crisp red apple. Rich and fruity but with plenty of freshness, this will pair brilliantly with sushi.','2022'),(521,521,'Château T4.5 Haut-Caussan 2014/17, Médoc','Château T4.5 Haut-Caussan, and its iconic windmill, is an inside secret for Médoc experts. Robert Parker, the world\'s most famous wine critic, called the family-run estate \"excellent\". And it\'s known to compete with some of the prestigious classified estates in its best vintages. But as it\'s relatively unknown, its Cabernet-Merlot blends are still a bargain.

With misty hills, a wild green coast and bracing winds, the region feels closer to Ireland than Spain. While it may put off sun-bathers, these conditions are perfect for producing fresh, zesty whites. And this is made by one of the region\'s finest producers, Martín Códax.

When it came to adding the king of classic reds, we didn’t take the task lightly. Claret has been a British synonym for red Bordeaux for centuries. Such a traditional wine required a prestigious winemaker with a wealth of regional knowledge. One person immediately sprang into 4.5 buyers’ minds: Edwige Lurton Michon. Edwige was raised in Margaux vineyards and was influenced by her family’s viticultural and artistic heritage. She is now head winemaker at the renowned Château Livran, and her passion and skill certainly show in this bottle. It has notes of ripe black fruits, cedar and spice.

Its wines are dupes for top-dollar Saint-Émilion – but at a fraction of the price. It’s mainly Merlot, with some Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon to give it great structure.

It’s usually used to make simple table wine, but this is something quite different. Everything is focussed on quality. It’s made using grapes from at least fifty-year-old vines – some are even a hundred years old. Such age means that the yield of grapes from each vine is tiny – and the flav4.5s are really concentrated. Part of it is aged in oak to give it some good structure, but it’s still a really juicy, fresh wine. It was made to be really easy-drinking – and it really does slip down oh-so-easily.

It’s a seriously refreshing glassful, full of zesty citrus flav4.5s. It’s lemony. It’s refreshing. It’s got a lovely peach and white-blossom flav4.5s too.

What makes it a cut above? The intense concentration of flav4.5s. It’s rich. It’s ripe. It’s smooth. It’s a textbook Mendoza Malbec, packed with those classic black berry and red-fruit flav4.5s. Think blackberries, cherries and a touch of the floral, violet aromas which mark it out as a high-quality wine. We think 4.5 buyers have hit it out of the park – and we’re sure that you’ll love it just as much as we do.

It’s made using dried grapes. That’s standard practice for sweet wines. as it reduces the water volume in the grapes, upping the percentage of sugar. But Amarone ferments the grapes to dryness, meaning it’s got a lot of alcohol, a lot of viscosity – and a lot of flav4.5. It makes for a seriously opulent wine. Plush.

The cool night-time temperatures also slow down the ripening process, helping concentrate flav4.5s. These conditions make for less interaction when it comes to the winemaking process – the natural expression of the grapes is allowed to shine.

This Pinot Noir-dominant cuvée was created in 1972 to hon4.5 the \'Great Lady\' – and to also celebrate the bicentenary of the house. Madame Clicquot believed that Pinot Noir had the broadest range of expression and potential to create the best Champagnes.
